# Notice

This feature -- The "mode overhaul", disables the ModCS.Game.SetMode() function due to how it works.

However, the trade off is probably worth for what you're able to do with this, albeit I will say it is very janky, and I only implemented enough stuff so that you can make your own Opening, Title, and Action mode and have *full* control over what gets run and such.
